## Story

Codecool is famous about its great community and one of the reasons for this is
the time spent well together - for instance with watching TV shows! That's why
there is a need for a great website where all Codecoolers can find his/her
favorite series.

Your job is to create such a site. The design has been already made by the
marketing team, there is also a database that is ready (thanks to
[trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/)), you "only" have to connect the dots and present
the data in a digestable way.

## Technologies used
* Python 
* Javascript 
* CSS, HTML, Bootstrap 
* Postgresql
